**PostgreSQL Interpreter using ANTLR4 and Python**

Simplified PostgreSQL Interpreter using ANTLR4 and Python 1
Simplified PostgreSQL
Interpreter using ANTLR4 and
Python
This proposal outlines the development of a simplified PostgreSQL interpreter as a
command-line application. The interpreter will be capable of parsing and executing a
subset of SQL statements, including table creation, data insertion, data querying with
basic filtering, and data deletion.
Features
The Simplified PostgreSQL Interpreter will support:
Table Creation: Syntax to define table structures, including column names and
data types.
Data Insertion: Mechanisms to insert data into tables following the defined
structures.
Data Querying: Ability to retrieve data using SELECT statements, with support for
basic WHERE clause conditionals for filtering results.
Data Deletion: Command to delete records from a table based on conditions.
The CLI application will support taking a .txt file as an input parameter, containing
the PostgreSQL statements to be interpreted and executed.
Technology Stack
In our Simplified PostgreSQL Interpreter, the following technologies will be
employed:
ANTLR4: This tool will be used to create the lexer and parser. We will define a
grammar for PostgreSQL statements in ANTLR4, which will then generate
Python code for parsing these statements.
Python: The main programming language of our application. Python will be used
to write the logic that will process the parsed PostgreSQL statements and
Simplified PostgreSQL Interpreter using ANTLR4 and Python 2
execute the commands.
ANTLR4 Python Runtime: This is a necessary component for running the
parser and lexer generated by ANTLR4. It will be used to navigate the parse tree
and trigger the appropriate actions within our application.
Methodology
To develop our Simplified PostgreSQL Interpreter, we will follow a step-by-step
methodology:
1. Grammar Definition: Craft a grammar file in ANTLR4 syntax for PostgreSQL,
detailing the structure of valid SQL commands.
2. Code Generation: Use ANTLR4 to generate the lexer and parser classes from
the defined grammar.
3. Interpreter Logic: Implement Python classes and methods that will use the
generated lexer and parser to read and interpret PostgreSQL commands from a
.txt file.
4. Evaluation Model: Develop an evaluation model in Python that will execute the
parsed statements and simulate the effects of the SQL commands, providing
output or reporting errors as necessary.
